# Text-Analysis
Analysis of tweets data on climate change


Text classification and anlysis using TF-IDF measurement and Prediction through NB,SVM,Logistic Regression Models

Code contains:

1.Making changes in the 'existence' column of data converting similar meaning words to a single word(Ex: Yes,Y,YES to yes)

2.Visualizing the data using a pie chart

3.Data preprocessing : removing URL'S,remove HTML tags,removing Punctuations,Tokenizing the words,removing stopwords,lemmatizing,stemming.

4.Analysis after Text preprocessing : Visualization of most used words in Positive and Negative tweets through WORDCLOUD and BARGRAPH

5.Using TF-IDF measurement for vectorizing the every words and for getting frequency scores for words

6.Prediction using Classification methods :NaiveBayes, SVM and Logistic Regression.

7.Analysing the predictions using Precision ,Recall f1-score and Confusion Matrix .
